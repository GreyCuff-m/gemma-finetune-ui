# 💡 Gemma Model Fine-Tuning UI – Empowering Customized AI Deployment

This project aims to simplify the process of fine-tuning [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) models by offering a user-friendly interface for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts. The UI enables dataset uploading, hyperparameter configuration, real-time visualization, and model export options — making customized AI deployment accessible to a broader community.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- 🎛️ Build an intuitive UI using Streamlit or Gradio
- 📂 Support multiple data formats: CSV, JSONL, text
- ⚙️ Real-time training visualizations (loss curves, metrics)
- ☁️ Optional cloud support with Google Cloud / Vertex AI
- 🧠 Export models in TF, PyTorch, and GGUF formats
- 📘 Include documentation, sample code, and tutorials
